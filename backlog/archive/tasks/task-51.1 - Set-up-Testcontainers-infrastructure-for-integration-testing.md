## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Add testcontainers-elixir library and configure it to run integration tests against real PostgreSQL containers. This provides the foundation for testing complex database operations, transactions, concurrent updates, and constraint enforcement that mocks cannot adequately test.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 testcontainers dependency added to mix.exs
- [ ] #2 Integration test helper module created with PostgreSQL container setup
- [ ] #3 Test tag :integration added to ExUnit configuration
- [ ] #4 Sample integration test written and passing with real container
- [ ] #5 Documentation added for running integration tests locally and in CI
- [ ] #6 CI pipeline configured to run integration tests with Docker support
