## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The login form currently labels local username/password authentication as being for "local development". This is misleading since local authentication is a fully supported, production-ready authentication method alongside OIDC.

Update the login form UI to present local authentication as a standard authentication option without implying it's only for development purposes.
